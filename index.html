        <p>
          Back in school, I had a dream to <span class="emphasis">become a programmer</span> . I managed to get into a
          Computer Science program, but
          unfortunately, I struggled immensely with programming. I couldn't understand the instructors, found it hard to
          concentrate for extended periods, and honestly, my personal life seemed to intrigue me more than my dream. So,
          after
          barely graduating, I ventured into a completely different field. I began as a recruiter and later transitioned
          into
          HR. I was successful and built an impressive career, <span class="emphasis-italic">leaving behind my initial
            dream.</span></p>
        <p>
          The next chapter in my journey was joining an IT company as an <span class="emphasis">HR manager</span>. Here,
          I was reminded of my
          aspiration
          to
          code. I took it upon myself to learn, and although the idea of a career switch was intimidating, I decided to
          pivot
          slightly within the same IT domain: I became a QA Engineer. Once again, I built my career from the ground up,
          advancing to a QA Lead position. However, working closely with developers, I never truly forgot what I
          truly
          desired.</p>
        <p>
          Now, after taking <span class="emphasis-italic">a three-year break</span> to relocate to a new country and
          fully immerse myself in the role of a
          full-time mother, <span class="emphasis">I'm setting out to turn that dream into a concrete objective and
            realize it.</span> On this page,
          you
          can
          discover more about me, my expertise, knowledge, passions, and interests.
