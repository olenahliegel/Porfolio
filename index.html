    Back in school, I had a dream to become a programmer. I managed to get into a Computer Science program, but
    unfortunately, I struggled immensely with programming. I couldn't understand the instructors, found it hard to
    concentrate for extended periods, and honestly, my personal life seemed to intrigue me more than my dream. So, after
    barely graduating, I ventured into a completely different field. I began as a recruiter and later transitioned into
    HR. I was successful and built an impressive career, leaving behind my initial dream.</p>
  <p>
    The next chapter in my journey was joining an IT company as an HR manager. Here, I was reminded of my aspiration to
    code. I took it upon myself to learn, and although the idea of a career switch was intimidating, I decided to pivot
    slightly within the same IT domain: I became a QA Engineer. Once again, I built my career from the ground up,
    advancing to a QA Manager position. However, working closely with developers, I never truly forgot what I truly
    desired.</p>
  <p>
    Now, after taking a three-year break to relocate to a new country and fully immerse myself in the role of a
    full-time mother, I'm setting out to turn that dream into a concrete objective and realize it. On this page, you can
    discover more about me, my expertise, knowledge, passions, and interests.
